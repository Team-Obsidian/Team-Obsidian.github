      <p class="white apple"> Well, well. Let's hope progress on this continues as intended. My current efforts are being put towards making this segment filled with enough text to wrap around the side of the screen. If it succeeds at that task, then I will have considered this job done. Also this actually has to be a bit longer so give me a few more lines of text to make sure this works. This last sentence is made the day after I created the previous changes so who know if it's really worth it to pursue the same train of thought as before.</p>
